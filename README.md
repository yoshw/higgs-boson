higgs-boson
===========

A half-finished science-themed text adventure, in which you venture into the "Standard Model Dungeon" in pursuit of the Higgs Boson.

## WARNING

This code is half-finished, bug-ridden and ugly. It was one of my first programming projects and was undertaken
with no software development experience or training, and little in the way of guidance. If you use it, use it
with care, and I recommend you avoid reading the code. It's not pleasant to look at.
